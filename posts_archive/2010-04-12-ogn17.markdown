<h2>Microslots</h2>

<p>These are five-minute "lightning" talks that anyone can volunteer for. They're easy to do: pick something that excites you, or a project you've worked on that you think might be of interest; then talk to a friendly audience for just five minutes with a handful of slides. <a href="http://natbat.wufoo.com/forms/oxford-geek-night-microslot-proposal/" >Submit your microslot</a> and we'll see you on the night!</p>
