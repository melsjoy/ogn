They're easy to do: pick something that excites you, or a project you've worked on that you think might be of interest; then talk to a friendly audience for just five minutes with a handful of slides. <a href="http://bit.ly/ogn-microslot" >Submit your microslot</a> and we'll see you on the night!</p>
